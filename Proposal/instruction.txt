My answer: 
Title: Pet Image Classification on Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset
Project Description: 
- This project is to classify pet images from the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset.
- There are 37 different classes of pets both dog and cat in the dataset. Only 12 classes of cats will be used for this project.
- Each class contains 180-200 images.

Why it is it good? 
- Dataset has different size of images, good for study preprocessing image.
- Dataset is for different cat breeds, good for study if model can classify cat breeds effectively or not.

How do you think you will do it? 
- Preprocessing image
- Data Augmentation to increase the amount of dataset
- Transfer learning to improve performance of the model as there is limited images data for each class.

What data will you use? 
- Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset 
- Only 12 classes of cats will be used for this project.

How to will you evaluate your system performance? 
- K-Fold Cross Validation
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Score
